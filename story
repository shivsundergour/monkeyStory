Once upon a time, there lived a monkey in a berry tree beside the river. One day a crocodile came across the river. 
It saw the monkey on the tree and asked for some juicy berries.
From that day onwards, they both became close friends. The Crocodile would daily come back to the monkey for berries. 
They both would use to have lots of fun together.
Sometimes the monkey would sit on the crocodile back and go around the river. 
Once the crocodile asked the monkey to get him some berries for his wife. The monkey plucked some berries and gave them to the crocodile.
